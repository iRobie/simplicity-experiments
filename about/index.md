# About
I'm documenting experiments in simplicity using forkable, version controlled articles. I've previously used paper to do this, but paper isn't the best at tracking changes.

## The experiments I'm focused on:

* Mindfulness
* Minimal effective dose, especially in regards to exercise
* Simple food
